            <p>From a cultural standpoint, coffeehouses largely serve as centers of social interaction: 
                a coffeehouse provides patrons with a place to congregate, talk, read, write, entertain one another, 
                or pass the time, whether individually or in small groups. 
            </p>
            <h4><em>We took it further</em></h4>
            <p>It all began with an idea that a cafe can be a positive force for good within our 
                local community.
                <br /> 
                Through showcasing the unique business and artistic talent Calgary has to offer, 
                all while serving the highest quality coffee and confectionery goods, 
                we can help fuel the city we love, and the people who make it great.
            </p>
